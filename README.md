1. Create a shortcode for a newsletter subscription input form with a mobile friendly submit
button. The default bg-color of the button is #333. Place the shortcode on an example page
or post with a #fff background as well as in the global footer (which has a dark #333
background).
- make sure the button is fully visible in both cases
- in case this short code is used twice on the viewed page (in the content of the current
page & in the footer), it should not interfere with itself in functionality or style
